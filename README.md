This project consists of 3 pages:

# First page:
    index.html

# Second page:  
    checkout.html

# Third page:
    order.html

# The first page is the mimic of the given task
# The checkout page
    - View the item,
    - Check the total amount,
    - Since details are not stored in a database, the details will be sent to the designers email, using Formspree,
    - Validations are done on the form,
    - The card details will not be sent to the email, and
    - After making payment you will be redirected to the order page.

# The order page:
    - View the item,
    - Check the total amount,
    - View the currect status of your order, and
    - By clicking on the steps you can see the steps on how the user will receive their item.


# Reminder
    This is a demo application so when going to the checkout and order page directly, some things will be missing, like the total amount.

# Additionals
    In the design folder I added images for the checkout and order page.
